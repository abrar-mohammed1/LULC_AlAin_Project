# Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Change Detection in Al Ain (2017â€“2023)

This project analyzes Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes in Al Ain, UAE, from 2017 to 2023 using Remote Sensing and GIS technologies. The main objective is to observe and quantify changes in land cover classes such as vegetation, urban development, bare land, and water bodies over time.

## Objectives:
- Detect and classify LULC changes in Al Ain between 2017 and 2023
- Identify patterns of urban expansion, vegetation loss or gain, and other land cover transitions
- Apply satellite imagery analysis using tools such as ArcGIS and remote sensing techniques

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Satellite Data:** Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery  
- **Software:** ArcGIS, QGIS, Google Earth Engine  
- **Methods:** Supervised classification, NDVI analysis, change detection techniques

## Outcomes:
- Classified LULC maps for 2017 and 2023
- Change detection analysis showing shifts in land use patterns
- Visualization and interpretation of LULC trends in Al Ain
